The 'g' object in Flask stands for "global" and is a special object provided by Flask that can be used to store data during a single request-response cycle. It's important to note that 'g' is specific to each request and not shared between different requests or users.

Understanding how it works:

1. The 'g' object is created at the beginning of each request.
2. It's available throughout the request handling process.
3. It's automatically cleared at the end of each request.

Here's a simple example of how to use the 'g' object:

```python
from flask import Flask, g

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    g.user = get_current_user()  # Assume this function exists

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return f"Hello, {g.user.name}"
```

Pros of using g object:

1. Request-specific storage: It provides a convenient way to store data that's specific to the current request.
2. Avoids passing data explicitly: You don't need to pass data through multiple function calls.
3. Thread-safe: Each request has its own 'g' object, so it's safe in multi-threaded environments.
4. Cleanup is automatic: Data is cleared at the end of each request, preventing data leaks between requests.

Cons of using g object:

1. Global nature: It's essentially a global variable for the request, which can make code harder to understand and maintain if overused.
2. Limited scope: Data only persists for the duration of a single request.
3. Potential for abuse: Overuse can lead to less explicit and harder-to-follow code.
4. Not suitable for long-term storage: Data is lost after the request is completed.

Real-world use cases:

1. User Authentication: Store the current user's information after authentication, making it available throughout the request.

```python
@app.before_request
def load_user():
    user_id = session.get('user_id')
    if user_id:
        g.user = User.query.get(user_id)
    else:
        g.user = None

@app.route('/dashboard')
def dashboard():
    if not g.user:
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    return render_template('dashboard.html', user=g.user)
```

2. Database Connections: Manage database connections for the duration of a request.

```python
from flask import g
import sqlite3

def get_db():
    if 'db' not in g:
        g.db = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    return g.db

@app.teardown_appcontext
def close_db(error):
    if hasattr(g, 'db'):
        g.db.close()
```

3. Request-specific caching: Cache data that's expensive to compute but used multiple times in a single request.

```python
@app.route('/expensive-operation')
def expensive_operation():
    if 'expensive_result' not in g:
        g.expensive_result = perform_expensive_calculation()
    return g.expensive_result
```

In conclusion, the 'g' object in Flask is a useful tool for managing request-specific data. While it can be very convenient, it should be used judiciously to maintain code clarity and prevent overreliance on global state.
