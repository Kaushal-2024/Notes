## Key Changes in Data Validation Methods
Transitioning to Pydantic v2 requires understanding critical updates to avoid errors and unlock the full potential of the framework.

### **Updated Methods and Terminology**
1. **Model Dump Method**:
   - **Replaced**: The `.dictionary` method is now deprecated.
   - **New Method**: Use `.model_dump` for similar functionality with added flexibility.

2. **Field Validators**:
   - **Replaced**: The older `@validator` method is replaced with `@field_validator`.
   - **Enhanced Features**: Field validators in v2 provide greater control over validation logic, making data handling more robust.

3. **Schema Configuration**:
   - **Changed**: The `schema_extra` configuration is now replaced with `json_schema_extra`.
   - **Impact**: This ensures compatibility with JSON Schema standards and avoids schema-related errors.
