For storing and managing large amounts of data from Excel files efficiently, especially when you need API integration for easy read and write operations, you have several options. Here are some of the most effective storage solutions you might consider:

1. **Relational Databases (e.g., [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))**
   - **Pros**: Structured query language ([SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)) for powerful data manipulation, strong consistency, [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliance.
   - **Cons**: Can become complex to scale horizontally.
   - **API Integration**: Most relational databases support [ODBC] connections and have extensive support in most programming languages.

2. **NoSQL Databases (e.g., [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/))**
   - **Pros**: Schema-less, which allows for flexibility in data structure; designed to scale out by adding more servers.
   - **Cons**: Lack of standardization, transactions can be more complex than in SQL.
   - **API Integration**: Provide [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), drivers in various programming languages, and often have good support for handling unstructured data like [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

3. **Cloud Storage Solutions (e.g., [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage))**
   - **Pros**: Highly scalable, reliable, and managed by the provider. Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
   - **Cons**: Generally, slower access times compared to block storage; requires internet connectivity.
   - **API Integration**: Extensive APIs for accessing and managing files, integration with other cloud services.

4. **Data Warehouses (e.g., [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery))**
   - **Pros**: Optimized for analytics and handling large volumes of data. Support for SQL queries.
   - **Cons**: More expensive for operational database usage; primarily designed for analytical reports.
   - **API Integration**: Support standard SQL and have connectors for many data integration tools.

5. **Distributed File Systems (e.g., [Hadoop HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/))**
   - **Pros**: Designed to store very large data sets reliably, and to stream those data sets at high bandwidth to user applications.
   - **Cons**: Requires management and tuning, more suitable for batch processing.
   - **API Integration**: APIs available for [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), etc., and can be integrated with other Hadoop ecosystem tools.

Pricing ModelsOn-Demand Pricing: You pay for the compute capacity by the hour with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. This can be beneficial for projects with variable workloads or for those who are still experimenting with Amazon Redshift.
Reserved Instances: These are available in 1-year or 3-year terms, where you commit to using a specific configuration. Reserved instances offer significant discounts over the on-demand rate, making them suitable for stable and predictable workloads.

Node Types
Dense Compute (DC): 
These nodes are optimized for performance-intensive workloads. They have fast CPUs, large amounts of RAM, and use SSD storage. They are more expensive but are designed for high-performance computing needs.
Dense Storage (DS):
These nodes are optimized for large data volumes and are less expensive than dense compute nodes. They use HDD storage which provides more storage capacity at a lower cost but with slower performance compared to SSDs.

Additional CostsData Transfer:
Data transfer "in" to Redshift is free, but data transfer "out" to the internet incurs charges. Transfers to other AWS  services within the same region are usually free, but cross-region transfers will have a cost associated with them.
 
Backup and Snapshot Storage: Amazon Redshift automatically replicates all your data within a data warehouse cluster and continuously backs up your data to S3 . AWS provides backup storage up to the total amount of storage for active cluster nodes at no additional charge. Additional backup storage beyond this amount is charged.
 
Concurrency Scaling: If you have fluctuating query loads, Redshift offers concurrency scaling which automatically adds additional cluster capacity to handle bursts in query load. You receive one hour of concurrency scaling credits per cluster per day at no additional charge, and beyond that, there is a charge.
