# With Lambda VS  Without Lambda

---

### **Scenario 1: Hosting on AWS Lambda (Serverless)**

**What It Is:**
- Your Flask app runs on AWS Lambda, which is a **serverless compute service**.
- Requests to your app are handled through **API Gateway**.

**Benefits:**
1. **No Server Management:** AWS handles all infrastructure (servers, scaling, etc.).
2. **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for the compute time used; great for apps with sporadic traffic.
3. **Scalability:** Automatically scales with traffic.
4. **Built-in High Availability:** No need to configure or worry about downtime.

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Stateless:** Lambda is stateless, so you need external storage for data persistence.
2. **Cold Starts:** The first request after a period of inactivity might be slower.
3. **Execution Limits:** Each request must finish within 15 minutes.

### **Scenario 2: Hosting Without AWS Lambda (Traditional Hosting)**

**Options:**
- Host your app on a server using **AWS EC2**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, or a third-party platform like **DigitalOcean** or **Heroku**.

**Benefits:**
1. **More Control:** You manage the server, environment, and configuration.
2. **Persistent State:** If your app needs to maintain a server-side state, this is easier to implement.
3. **Long-Running Tasks:** No execution time limits.
4. **Familiarity:** You can use traditional methods like WSGI with Gunicorn and NGINX.

**Drawbacks:**
1. **Higher Costs for Low-Traffic Apps:** Servers run 24/7, even if no one is using the app.
2. **Manual Scaling:** You must configure scaling manually to handle spikes in traffic.
3. **Maintenance Overhead:** You are responsible for server updates, security patches, etc.

### **Key Differences**

| Feature                | AWS Lambda (Serverless)                      | Traditional Hosting                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure**     | Fully managed by AWS                         | Managed by you                        |
| **Cost Model**         | Pay per request                              | Fixed cost (server runs 24/7)         |
| **Scalability**        | Auto-scaling by default                      | Manual or semi-automatic scaling      |
| **Control**            | Limited (AWS manages everything)             | Full control over the server          |
| **State Management**   | Stateless (requires external solutions)      | Can be stateful                       |
| **Execution Limits**   | 15-minute max runtime per request            | No runtime limits                     |
| **Ease of Setup**      | Fast (with tools like Zappa)                 | Requires more setup effort            |

### **Which Should You Choose?**
- **Use AWS Lambda** if:
  - Your app has low, unpredictable traffic.
  - You prefer minimal server management.
  - Cost savings and scalability are priorities.

- **Use Traditional Hosting** if:
  - Your app needs persistent server-side state.
  - You expect high, consistent traffic.
  - You need more control over the environment.
