# AWS Developer Associate (DVA-C02) — 7-Day High-Impact Study Strategy

> **Goal:** Pass the AWS Developer Associate certification exam in **7 days** by focusing only on what actually appears in the exam.

This guide summarizes a proven, exam-focused strategy shared by **Sleman**, a cloud security consultant and educator. It challenges the traditional 2–3 month preparation approach and replaces it with a **predictable, high-yield, time-efficient plan**.

---

## Why Most People Study Inefficiently

Most candidates fail or overprepare because they:

* Watch long video courses linearly
* Study **all AWS services equally**
* Use scattered tools (YouTube, notes, flashcards, mock exams)
* Skip early diagnostic testing
* Overload on **out-of-scope topics**

👉 The AWS Developer Associate exam is **highly predictable** and repeatedly tests the same services and patterns.

---

## Key Exam Reality Checks

* The exam **recycles services and question patterns**
* Not all topics have equal weight
* Many services are **explicitly out of scope**
* Smart prioritization = faster pass

## AWS Developer Associate Exam Domains

| Domain                         | Weight  | What It Really Tests               |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Development with AWS Services  | **32%** | Lambda, DynamoDB, API integrations |
| Security                       | **26%** | IAM, encryption, authentication    |
| Deployment                     | **24%** | CI/CD, deployment strategies       |
| Troubleshooting & Optimization | **18%** | Logs, metrics, tracing             |

> ❌ **Out of scope:**
>
> * Architecture design
> * OS / server management
> * VPC design
>   (These belong to Solutions Architect exams)

## AWS Services — What to Study (and How Deep)

### 🟢 Tier 1 — **Must Know Deeply**

> Core services that appear **constantly**

* Lambda
* API Gateway
* DynamoDB
* S3
* SQS
* SNS
* IAM

🔎 Focus on:

* Use cases
* Scaling behavior
* Error handling
* Security patterns
* Service integration

---

### 🟡 Tier 2 — **Conceptual Understanding**

> Moderate exam presence

* Cognito
* KMS
* Secrets Manager
* Parameter Store
* CloudWatch
* X-Ray
* CodePipeline / CodeBuild / CodeDeploy
* CloudFormation
* EventBridge
* Step Functions
* ElastiCache

🔎 Know:

* What problem they solve
* When to use them
* Basic configuration concepts

---

### 🟠 Between Tier 1 & 3

* Elastic Beanstalk
* ECS

🔎 Understand:

* Deployment model
* Use cases
* Operational responsibility

---

### 🔵 Tier 3 — **Awareness Only**

> Minimal exam coverage

* Kinesis
* AppSync
* Amplify

---

## The 7-Day Study Plan

### **Day 1 — Diagnostic & Gap Analysis**

* Take a **full 65-question mock exam cold**
* Do NOT study before this
* Analyze every wrong answer:

  * Domain
  * Service
  * Concept

🎯 Purpose: identify gaps and avoid wasted study time

---

### **Day 2 — Core Services (Part 1)**

**Lambda + API Gateway**

* Triggers, scaling, retries, DLQs
* REST vs HTTP APIs
* Authorization (IAM, Cognito, Lambda authorizers)

📝 Practice: 20–30 targeted questions

---

### **Day 3 — Core Services (Part 2)**

**DynamoDB, S3, SQS, SNS**

* DynamoDB keys, indexes, capacity modes
* S3 security, events, integrations
* SQS vs SNS vs EventBridge

📝 Practice: 30+ questions
🔁 Review Day 2 mistakes

---

### **Day 4 — Security**

* IAM policies & least privilege
* Cognito (User Pools vs Identity Pools)
* KMS encryption
* Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store

📝 Practice: 20–30 security questions
🔁 Review previous topics

---

### **Day 5 — Deployment**

* CI/CD pipeline flow
* CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
* Deployment strategies:

  * Rolling
  * Blue/Green
  * Canary
* Infrastructure as Code:

  * CloudFormation
  * SAM

📝 Practice + cumulative review

---

### **Day 6 — Troubleshooting + Mock Exam Gauntlet**

* CloudWatch logs, metrics, alarms
* X-Ray tracing
* Common failure patterns

🧪 Take **multiple full mock exams**

* Analyze every wrong answer
* Identify repeating weak areas

---

### **Day 7 — Final Review + Exam**

* Light review only
* Flashcards for Tier 1 services
* No new topics
* Sit for the exam

---

## Exam Day Strategy

### ⏱ Time Management

* 130 minutes / 65 questions ≈ 2 min per question
* Flag difficult ones and move on

---

### 🧠 Question Tactics

* Read carefully — constraints hide in the middle
* Eliminate 1–2 wrong options immediately
* Look for AWS “preferred patterns”

---

### ✅ AWS Preferred Patterns

* **Scalability:** Serverless (Lambda, DynamoDB)
* **Low ops overhead:** Managed services
* **Security:** Least privilege + encryption
* **Decoupling:** SQS, SNS, EventBridge

---

### 🧘 Mental Game

* ~15 questions are **unscored**
* Expect unfamiliar services
* Don’t panic — make the best choice and move on

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Treating all topics equally
* Skipping the diagnostic mock exam
* Underestimating security (26%!)
* Ignoring CI/CD and deployment strategies
* Studying irrelevant AWS services
* Watching full courses without targeting gaps

---

## Tooling Insight — Smarter Study, Not Harder

Traditional prep is fragmented and inefficient.

**Study Techch AI** aims to fix this by:

* Identifying knowledge gaps
* Providing unlimited mock exams
* One-click flashcards
* AI-generated daily study plans
* Community + expert support

🎯 Goal: reduce prep time from **months → weeks**

---

## Career Reality Check

* Certification ≠ job guarantee
* Many certified candidates still lack hands-on skills
* Use certification as:

  * A credibility signal
  * A structured learning milestone
* Continue building real projects and experience

---

## Key Takeaway

> **The AWS Developer Associate exam is predictable.
> You don’t need more time — you need better focus.**

Diagnose early, study what matters, practice relentlessly, and pass with confidence.
