## 🧠 1. Core Technical Topics to Revise

### 🔹 **Frontend (React.js)**

**Must know in depth:**

* Functional vs Class Components (with examples)
* React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useContext`
* State management (Redux, Zustand, or Context API)
* React Router (v6)
* Lazy loading (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)
* API Integration using Axios / Fetch
* Handling forms (Formik / React Hook Form)
* Component lifecycle flow
* Performance optimization (memoization, key usage, re-renders)
* Error boundaries & code splitting
* Responsive UI: CSS Grid, Flexbox, Bootstrap
* Common bugs: unmounted state updates, dependency array issues, etc.

**Practical Prep:**

* Be ready to **code a small React component** (e.g. Todo app, Pagination, Search filter)
* Explain **how you debug a React issue**

---

### 🔹 **Backend (Python + Django + Flask + FastAPI)**

**Revise these clearly:**

* Django:

  * Models, ORM, QuerySets
  * Views (Class-based & Function-based)
  * Middleware, Signals
  * Authentication (JWT, DRF)
  * Deployment (Gunicorn, Nginx)
* Flask & FastAPI:

  * Routing, dependency injection
  * Pydantic models
  * Async endpoints in FastAPI
* REST API Design:

  * Status codes, Pagination, Filtering, Error handling
* Database Integration:

  * PostgreSQL & ORM relationships
  * Migrations, indexes, transactions

**Common interview tasks:**

* “Write a CRUD API for Users or Products”
* “Explain difference between Flask, Django, and FastAPI”
* “Design an endpoint that filters users by multiple parameters”

---

### 🔹 **Databases**

* SQL Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries
* Django ORM equivalents of complex queries
* Optimization (indexes, N+1 query problem)
* Difference between relational (Postgres/MySQL) vs NoSQL (MongoDB)

---

### 🔹 **DevOps / Tools**

* Docker basics (Dockerfile, docker-compose)
* Git workflow (branching, merging, pull requests)
* AWS (EC2, S3, RDS basic understanding)
* Debugging logs & monitoring
* CI/CD conceptually (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

---

## 💬 2. Communication & Soft Skills for US Clients

Since this is a **U.S. client-facing interview**, you’ll be evaluated on clarity, confidence, and collaboration skills as much as your coding.

### Tips:

* Speak clearly and **slowly**, use short sentences.
* Practice saying:

  * “Let me clarify what you’re asking.”
  * “I’ll approach it step by step.”
  * “In my experience, the best approach is…”
* Be honest about unknowns:
  “I haven’t implemented that directly, but I know the concept and can adapt quickly.”
* Keep examples from your **projects (Mybitofit, Codelos, Thkee)** ready to show **problem-solving and ownership**.

---

## 💼 3. Project Deep Dive Preparation

You *must* be able to **explain these projects technically** — focus on architecture, challenges, and your role.

### Example: **Mybitofit**

* **Tech Stack:** React (frontend), Django/FastAPI (backend), Postgres (DB)
* **Architecture:** SPA frontend + REST APIs
* **Challenge Example:** Image rendering on a large map, optimizing re-renders, and caching data.
* **Key talking points:**

  * How you structured React components
  * How you handled performance
  * How you managed API rate limits or caching
  * Deployment pipeline

### Example: **Codelos**

* **Problem solved:** Workflow automation (no-code builder)
* **Tech Challenge:** Designing reusable workflow logic
* **Show off:** Use of dynamic forms, schema-driven design, backend modularity

### Example: **Thkee**

* **Focus:** eLearning platform
* **Key Topics:** Role-based access (instructor/student), file uploads, real-time/live features, coupon logic
* **Possible Questions:**

  * How you managed authentication
  * How the video streaming/quiz logic works

## 🧩 5. Small System Design & API Design

Be ready to design simple systems, like:

* URL shortener
* Task management app
* E-learning backend (users, courses, enrollments)

Focus on:

* ER diagram thinking
* Endpoints (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE)
* Database structure
* Caching and pagination
