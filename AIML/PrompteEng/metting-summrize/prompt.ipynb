    "    [09:00 AM] Scrum Master (Priya): Good morning, team. Let’s get started. Usual format—updates, blockers, then action items. Let’s begin with you, Arjun.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:01 AM] Arjun: Sure. Yesterday, I finalized the user authentication logic using OAuth2 with FastAPI. Ran tests, all green. Today I’ll refactor the token refresh logic—it’s still a bit messy. No blockers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:02 AM] Priya: Great. Can you log that in Jira?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:02 AM] Arjun: Yep, doing it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:03 AM] Priya: Thanks. Maya, you’re up.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:03 AM] Maya: I’ve been working on the email notification service. The basic functionality is done—sending, retries, and logging. I’ll add unit tests today. One blocker: I need access to the staging SMTP creds. I pinged DevOps but no response yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:04 AM] Priya: Got it. I’ll follow up with DevOps on that today.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:04 AM] Maya: Thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:05 AM] Priya: Ahmed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:05 AM] Ahmed: Yesterday I integrated the Redis cache layer for user sessions. Huge improvement in response times—down from 250ms to 90ms. Today I’m cleaning up the middleware pipeline. No blockers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:06 AM] Priya: Nice performance boost!\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:06 AM] Priya: Neha?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:07 AM] Neha: So I’m on the report generation module. Right now, I’m debugging some Pandas logic for exporting large data sets to CSV. Ran into a memory issue when datasets cross 1M rows. I’ll try chunking and test that today. Slight blocker—need confirmation on the expected format from product team.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:08 AM] Priya: Let’s escalate that after the call—I’ll tag Ritu from product. Anything else?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:08 AM] Neha: Nope, that’s all.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:09 AM] Priya: Cool. Rohan?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:09 AM] Rohan: Yesterday I worked on API versioning for backward compatibility. Added headers-based versioning for now. Today I’ll write docs and examples. No blockers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:10 AM] Priya: Perfect. Shreya?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:10 AM] Shreya: I was pairing with Neha on the reporting issue—helped track down a memory leak in one of the transformation steps. I’ll switch to CI/CD today—updating workflows to handle pull request checks more robustly. No blockers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:11 AM] Priya: Love the pairing effort\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:12 AM] Priya: Quick heads-up—this sprint ends Friday. Please update all your Jira tickets. Also, we’re doing a retro Monday at 10 AM. I’ll send out the invite.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:13 AM] Maya: Got it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:13 AM] Arjun: All good.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:14 AM] Priya: Alright, let’s quickly run through action items:\n",
    "    - Maya needs SMTP staging creds—Priya to follow up.\n",
    "    - Neha needs CSV format confirmation—Priya to escalate to product.\n",
    "    - Everyone to update Jira statuses today.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:16 AM] Priya: Any cross-team dependencies or heads-ups?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:16 AM] Ahmed: One thing—DevOps mentioned the staging DB will be down tonight from 9–10 PM for patching.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:17 AM] Priya: Thanks for the heads-up. Will Slack the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:18 AM] Neha: Can we increase the EBS volume on the test server? I keep running into disk space issues during exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:18 AM] Priya: I’ll raise a ticket for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:19 AM] Shreya: Also, I’d like to propose a 15-min tech talk every Thursday—could be anything Python or tooling related. Thoughts?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:19 AM] Maya: Love that idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:20 AM] Rohan: I can do the first one on Pydantic performance tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:20 AM] Priya: Amazing! Let’s make it happen. I’ll send a poll for topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:21 AM] Priya: Alright, anything else?\n",
    "\n",
    "    [09:21 AM] All: Nope / All good / That’s it.\n",
