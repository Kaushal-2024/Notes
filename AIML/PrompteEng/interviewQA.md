**Prompt Engineer Interview Questions and Answers**

---

### 1. General Understanding

**Q: What is prompt engineering, and why is it important in the context of LLMs?**
A: Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to guide language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to produce desired outputs. It's crucial for improving performance, reliability, and usability of LLMs across tasks.

**Q: Explain the difference between zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting.**
A: Zero-shot prompting asks the model to perform a task with no examples. One-shot includes a single example, and few-shot includes multiple examples to demonstrate the task, improving accuracy.

**Q: What are tokens in language models, and why do they matter?**
A: Tokens are pieces of text (words, characters, or subwords) the model reads. Token limits affect how much context you can provide in a prompt, impacting performance.

**Q: How do you evaluate whether a prompt is effective?**
A: Evaluate based on accuracy, relevance, consistency, and whether the format and style match expectations. Human review and automated metrics like BLEU or ROUGE may be used.

### 2. Technical Skills

**Q: How would you design a prompt to extract structured data (like JSON) from an unstructured input?**
A: Use clear instructions and formatting expectations, such as: 
"Extract product information in the following format: {"name": "", "price": "", "quantity": ""}."

**Q: How do you ensure strict output formatting (e.g., SQL or CSV)?**
A: Instruct explicitly: "Respond with only valid SQL code" or "Output must be comma-separated without extra text." Use delimiters like markdown code blocks for clarity.

**Q: Describe prompt chaining.**
A: Prompt chaining involves passing the output of one prompt into another. Useful for complex workflows like summarizing then translating a document.

**Q: How do you handle context length limitations?**
A: Trim or summarize inputs, use embeddings for relevance ranking, or segment tasks into multiple prompts to fit within token limits.

### 3. Applied Scenarios

**Q: Design a prompt to extract product names and prices from a paragraph.**
A: "Extract all product names and their prices from the text below and return as JSON."

**Q: Strategies for chatbot politeness and accuracy?**
A: Define tone and behavior: "Always respond politely and helpfully." Reinforce boundaries: "Do not make up facts; say 'I don't know' if unsure."

**Q: Summarizing legal documents with critical info?**
A: Prompt example: "Summarize the following legal text, highlighting obligations, deadlines, and key terms."

**Q: How to reduce hallucination?**
A: Use grounding techniques (RAG), clear and constrained prompts, system messages defining model behavior, and post-processing validations.

### 4. Evaluation and Testing

**Q: How to evaluate prompt performance?**
A: Use task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification), user satisfaction scores, and error analysis.

**Q: Conducting A/B testing for prompts?**
A: Show different users prompt variants, collect qualitative/quantitative feedback, and analyze performance deltas.

**Q: Tools for prompt testing/evaluation?**
A: LangChain, PromptLayer, Humanloop, or custom logging and analysis frameworks.

### 5. Model Awareness

**Q: Strengths/weaknesses of GPT-4 vs Claude vs Mistral vs LLaMA?**
A: GPT-4 excels in reasoning, Claude in long context and safety, Mistral is open and efficient, LLaMA is useful for fine-tuning and offline deployment.

**Q: Adjusting prompts for different models?**
A: Consider model limits, instructio
