But, yeah, I know Dr. Pope.

So, yeah, there are some small, rough, scaly papules we call them, or little rough spots on the crown of your scalp. Mhmm. And they\\'re called actinic keratosis.; 61.07-78.905s\", \"Dr. Adrian: They\\'re little precancerous lesions. Think of it like weeds in a garden. Not a huge deal, but they\\'re little weeds that can become bad when they start to grow too big, so we just have to treat them to kill them.; 79.145-95.965s\", \\'Dr. Adrian: I think the TCA thirty-five is going to be used. There are approximately about ten little bitty ones throughout.; 95.965-106.05s\\', \"Dr. Adrian: So I\\'m going to put a chemical on it to make them peel.

We\\'re going to do a total of ten actinic keratosis treatments with TCA, or trichloroacetic acid, thirty-five percent.; 129.585-154.625s\", \"Dr. Adrian: This is going to hurt just a tiny bit, okay?

New patient here for a skin check.; 0.48-6.72s\\n  Robert: Yes.; 6.96-7.76s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Yes. And for two.; 7.76-9.52s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Hello. Is this Robert?; 13.275-14.475s\\n  Robert: Yes, it is.; 14.475-15.035s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Robert, Dr. Adrian. Good to meet you.; 15.035-16.955s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Have a seat. Okay.; 17.275-18.875s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Where are you from, Robert?; 19.275-20.635s\\n  Robert: Emory.; 20.635-23.835s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Oh, Emory? Yeah.; 23.835-29.28s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Good to meet you. How was the drive? Good day. Are you going to Richfield often?; 29.28-34.32s\\n  Robert: This is the doctor\\'s office. We visit Dr. Pope, our main doctor.; 35.6-41.025s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Oh, yeah. I know Dr. Pope. I used to live nearby him too, and I moved to Richfield, but he lives in Central. But, yeah, I know Dr. Pope. So what do we do for you today, Robert?; 41.025-51.585s\\n  Robert: I have a few spots on my head that need to be looked at.; 51.87-54.75s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Let\\'s take a look. Have you ever seen a skin doctor before?; 54.75-61.07s\\n  Robert: No.; 61.07-78.905s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Okay. So, yeah, there are some small, rough, scaly papules we call them, or little rough spots on the crown of your scalp. Mhmm. And they\\'re called actinic keratosis.; 61.07-78.905s\\n  Dr. Adrian: They\\'re little precancerous lesions. Think of it like weeds in a garden. Not a huge deal, but they\\'re little weeds that can become bad when they start to grow too big, so we just have to treat them to kill them.; 79.145-95.965s\\n  Dr. Adrian: I think the TCA thirty-five is going to be used. There are approximately about ten little bitty ones throughout.; 95.965-106.05s\\n  Dr. Adrian: So I\\'m going to put a chemical on it to make them peel. It\\'s going to hurt a little, it\\'s going to get red, and they\\'re going to peel off like a sunburn.; 106.05-128.705s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Rather than burning individual ones, I\\'m just going to treat the whole area. We\\'re going to do a total of ten actinic keratosis treatments with TCA, or trichloroacetic acid, thirty-five percent.; 129.585-154.625s\\n  Dr. Adrian: This is going to hurt just a tiny bit, okay? Not at first, you\\'re just going to feel wet.; 154.785-155.825s\\n  Robert: Just wet.; 155.825-159.985s\\n  Dr. Adrian: Okay. Well, I\\'ll know we just have to put maybe a couple more layers on until it starts to get white. Alright. How\\'s the feeling?; 197.32-237.095s\\n  Robert: Okay.; 409.05-409.37s\\n  Dr. Adrian: So there is actually a total of about twenty actinic keratosis on the crown instead of ten.; 439.22-447.46s\\n'}]"

Your task is to analyze a given CPT code (or a list of them) and return all related **sister/family codes**, using CPT code hierarchy and procedural similarity.\\n\\n### Sister / Family CPT Code Retrieval\\nFor each input CPT code:\\n1. Identify **sibling codes** – codes within the same procedural group or code range.\\n2. Include **parent category**, **modifiers**, and **alternate code options** if applicable.\\n3. Suggest **clinically related procedures** that serve similar diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.\\n\\n\\n**For each CPT code, output the following:**\\n\\n**Input CPT Code:**\\n**Procedure Description:**\\n\\n**Sister/Family CPT Codes:**\\n- **Code:**\\n- **Procedure Description:**\\n- **Relation Type:** Sibling / Modifier Variant / Parent Category / Alternate Procedure\\n- **Modifiers:**  CPT modifiers, if any, as a string. Modifiers : it provide additional information about a procedure or service, without altering the core meaning of the CPT code itself\\n- **Relation Type:** The CPT code that these related codes are derived from.\\n- **Reasoning:** Explain relationship (e.g., \"same code range\", \"different approach to same procedure\", \"with vs. without contrast\", etc.)\\nBe comprehensive. Use both CPT coding structure and clinical context to discover related codes. The goal is to build a **full set of procedural options** for:\\n- Clinical decision-making\\n- Billing strategy\\n- Code optimization\\n- Alternative procedural documentation\\n\\nUse medical reasoning and CPT grouping logic when inferring relationships.\\n\\n### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT\\n\\nReturn your output in the following strict JSON structure:\\n\\n{\\n  \"cpt\": [\\n    {\\n      \"code\": \"[CPT code for procedure/service]\",\\n      \"name\": \"[Name according to CPT code]\",\\n      \"description\": \"[Official CPT code description]\",\\n      \"relation_type\": Sibling / Modifier Variant / Parent Category / Alternate Procedure\\n      \"relation_with\": The initial code from which these connections are made[Base CPT Code for Relationships].\\n      \"reason\": \"[Why this CPT code applies, citing evidence from transcript]\",\\n      \"modifiers\": \"[CPT modifiers, if any, as a string]\",\\n      \"associated_ICD\": [\"[ICD-10-CM code]\"]\\n    }\\n    // Additional entries for other procedures/services\\n  ]\\n}\\n'},\n",
