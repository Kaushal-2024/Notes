# [Web Hooks (Http CallBacks)](https://youtu.be/GND6y6lolZw?si=O-I0EGxMy0yEmVxq)

## Key Takeaways

* **APIs and webhooks are both ways for two applications to communicate with each other.**
* **APIs require a request from one application to another, while webhooks send a response to an application without a request.**
* **APIs are typically used for more complex tasks, such as retrieving or modifying data.**
* **Webhooks are typically used for real-time notifications, such as when a payment is received.**

**Specific examples of when to use APIs and webhooks:**

* **APIs:**
    * Retrieving data from a third-party service, such as a weather API or a stock API.
    * Modifying data in a third-party service, such as creating a new user account or updating a product listing.
* **Webhooks:**
    * Receiving notifications about events, such as when a new email arrives or when a payment is received.
    * Sending notifications to other applications, such as when a new order is placed or when a new product is released.

**Conclusion:**

APIs and webhooks are both powerful tools that can be used to improve communication between applications. The best choice for a particular use case will depend on the specific needs of the application.

## Here are the key takeaways from the transcript chunk you provided:

* **Webhooks are a type of API that are triggered by events.**
* **Webhooks can be used to send real-time notifications from one application to another.**
* **Webhooks can be used to improve the communication between applications.**

In the specific example provided in the transcript, webhooks are used to communicate between a payment gateway and an e-commerce website. When a payment is made through the payment gateway, a webhook is sent to the e-commerce website. The webhook includes information about the payment, such as the amount, the order number, and the status.

The e-commerce website can then use this information to update the order status. For example, if the payment is successful, the order status can be changed to "paid."

Here are some additional details from the transcript that may be helpful:

* **Webhooks can be used to trigger a variety of events.**
* **Webhooks can be used to send data in a variety of formats.**
* **Webhooks can be used to improve the efficiency and reliability of applications.**
