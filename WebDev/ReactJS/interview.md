intro

Good morning, my name is Kaushal Tarapra. Iâ€™m a software developer with around 1 year of experience, currently working at EspakrBiz. During this time, Iâ€™ve worked primarily with React and TypeScript, building scalable and responsive web applications.

One of the key projects I contributed to was the Versio project, where I worked on component development, API integration, and state management.

Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, UI performance, and learning modern frontend technologies. Iâ€™m excited for the opportunity to contribute and grow further with your team.


*Batching in react
Batching is the process where React groups multiple state updates together into a single re-render to improve performance.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **React Hooks**

| Hook          | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Manage local component state.                             |
| `useEffect`   | Handle side effects (API calls, subscriptions, timers).   |
| `useContext`  | Access shared data without prop drilling.                 |
| `useReducer`  | Manage complex state using reducers (like Redux pattern). |
| `useMemo`     | Memoize expensive calculations.                           |
| `useCallback` | Memoize functions to prevent re-renders.                  |
| `useRef`      | Access DOM or persist values across renders.              |

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**

* **What**: Function that takes a component and returns an enhanced component.
* **Why**: Logic reuse (e.g., auth checks, theming).
* **When**: Wrap components to share behavior.
* **How**:

  ```js
  const withLogger = (Component) => (props) => {
    console.log('Render:', Component.name);
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
  ```

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)**

| Phase      | Methods                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Mounting   | `constructor`, `componentDidMount`            |
| Updating   | `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate` |
| Unmounting | `componentWillUnmount`                        |

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **State Management Basics**

* **State**: Internal data (via `useState`, `this.state`).
* **Props**: Data passed from parent.
* **Prop Drilling**: Passing props through multiple layers.
* **Context API**: Avoids prop drilling by sharing data globally.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Redux / Zustand (Global State)**

* **Redux**:

  * Centralized state, strict structure (actions, reducers).
  * Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) for simplicity.
* **Zustand**:

  * Lightweight, simpler syntax, less boilerplate.
* **When to use**:

  * App-wide state, multiple consumers, or complex state interactions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Custom Hooks**

* **Why**: Reuse logic (e.g., fetch, localStorage).
* **How**:

  ```js
  function useLocalStorage(key, init) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(() => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key)) || init);
    useEffect(() => localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value)), [value]);
    return [value, setValue];
  }
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Lazy Loading + Code Splitting**

* **Code Splitting**: Load only whatâ€™s needed.
* **Chunking**: Split large files into smaller ones.
* **Suspense**: Shows fallback while loading.

  ```js
  const LazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./Comp'));
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Virtual DOM and Rendering**

| Concept           | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Virtual DOM       | Lightweight copy of the real DOM for efficient updates. |
| Reconciliation    | Compare old vs new Virtual DOM.                         |
| Diffing Algorithm | Finds minimal changes.                                  |
| React Fiber       | Incremental rendering engine for responsiveness.        |

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. **SSR vs CSR**

| Feature | SSR (Server-Side Rendering) | CSR (Client-Side Rendering) |
| ------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Render  | On the server               | In the browser              |
| SEO     | Better SEO                  | Needs extra setup for SEO   |
| Speed   | Faster first paint          | Slower initial load         |

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. **Routing (with RBAC)**

* **react-router**: Navigation and routing.
* **Protected Routes**: Check auth before rendering route.
* **Query Params**: `useSearchParams`, `useLocation`.
* **Dynamic Routes**: Based on data (e.g., `/product/:id`).

### ðŸ”¹ 11. **Testing**

| Type                                               | Tool/Use                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Unit Test                                          | Test component logic         |
| Integration                                        | Test flow between components |
| RTL (React Testing Library)\*\*: Tests UI behavior |                              |
| Best Practice                                      | Write testable, modular code |

---

### ðŸ”¹ 12. **Async Handling**

* **API calls**: Done in `useEffect`.
* **Events**: Clicks, input handlers.
* **Promises**: Handle async logic cleanly.
* **Timers**: `setTimeout`, `setInterval` in `useEffect`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 13. **Code Quality Principles**

* **Reusability**: DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).
* **Readability**: Clear, consistent naming.
* **Modularity**: Small, single-purpose components.
* **Testability**: Write logic thatâ€™s easy to test.

### ðŸ”¹ 14. **Performance Optimization**

| Technique               | Example                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Lazy Loading            | Load pages/components as needed        |
| Memoization             | `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` |
| Bundle Optimization     | Tree shaking, chunk splitting          |
| CDN/Server Optimization | Host assets via CDN                    |
| UX                      | Skeletons, shimmer UI                  |

### ðŸ”¹ 15. **Styling Options**

| Approach          | Pros                            | Cons                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Tailwind CSS      | Utility-first, fast             | Steeper learning curve          |
| CSS / SCSS        | Native, scoped with modules     | Can get messy in large projects |
| Styled-Components | JS-based, scoped styles         | Slight runtime overhead         |
| Bootstrap / MUI   | Prebuilt, responsive components | Less customizable               |
| StyleX            | Metaâ€™s modern styling framework | Newer, still evolving           |
